 > You will be forming a group of **THREE** students and work on an interesting project that you will propose yourself (in this `README.md` document). You can pick any project that you'd like, but it needs ot implement three design patterns. Each of the members in a group is expected to work on at least one design pattern and its test cases. You can, of course, help each other, but it needs to be clear who will be responsible for which pattern and for which general project features.
 
 > ## Expectations
 > * Incorporate **three** distinct design patterns, *two* of the design patterns need to be taught in this course:
 >   * Composite, Strategy, Abstract Factory, Visitor
 > * All three design patterns need to be linked together (it can't be three distinct projects)
 > * Your project should be implemented in C/C++. If you wish to choose anoher programming language (e.g. Java, Python), please discuss with your lab TA to obtain permission.
 > * You can incorporate additional technologies/tools but they must be approved (in writing) by the instructor or the TA.
 > * Each member of the group **must** be committing code regularly and make sure their code is correctly attributed to them. We will be checking attributions to determine if there was equal contribution to the project.

## Project Description
This project is important because it’s purpose is to help people become healthy. By seeing where there are gaps in the health of the user, the program will tailor a meal plan and exercise routine for them. Instead of having a doctor simply say to a patient “eat healthier and exercise more”, now the patient can see exactly what foods to add to their diet and how much exercise to do in order to fill in the gaps in their health. Our application will focus on the health and wellness of the user, through inputs of certain levels such as cholesterol and blood pressure along with age, weight, and height. These numbers will be inputted in by the user and our application will output a meal plan and exercise routine tailored to the information that the user inputed. Our project will be written in C++. Our goal is to turn our project idea into a graphical user interface (GUI) using an application programming interface (API) that will support it being written in C++. Our group has come across a few possible APIs to use in our project such as GTK, Qt, or wxWidgets. We are not too familiar with creating GUIs, so we will be starting earlier to test and see which tools we prefer. The three design patterns that we are looking into using are:
   * Composite
	* Like mentioned in class a composite design pattern allows for simple and complex hierarchies. In class Professor Reem used the example of graphics being broken down to lines, rectangles, and text. We thought this design pattern would work well for our project, because of diversity our application will allow. Our application will not be restricted to any one group of people, but everyone. So this design pattern will allow us to put our users into specific hierarchies. 
   * Facade
	* 
   * Visitor
	* We have not gone over the visitor design pattern yet in class, but from our group’s research this pattern seems to be useful for our project. Since our project will be taking many different inputs from the user and having to do different calculations for each input the visitor design pattern will make adding new systems easy, because we will not have to affect other existing item classes that we have created. The visitor design pattern is used when you perform an operation on similar kinds of objects. Since our inputs can be diverse we will use this pattern for each group we create and conduct their calculations within them. 

 > Your project description should summarize the project you are proposing. Be sure to include
 > * Why is it important or interesting to you?
 > * What languages/tools/technologies do you plan to use? (This list may change over the course of the project)
 >   * [toolname](link) - Short description
 > * What will be the input/output of your project?
 > * What are the three design patterns you will be using. For each design pattern you must:
 >   * Explain in 3 - 5 sentences why you picked this pattern and what feature you will implement with it
 > * This description should be in enough detail that the TA/instructor can determine the complexity of the project and if it is sufficient for the team members to complete in the time allotted. 

 > ## Phase II
 > In addition to completing the "Class Diagram" section below, you will need to 
 > * Set up your GitHub project board as a Kanban board for the project. It should have columns that map roughly to 
 >   * Backlog, TODO, In progress, In testing, Done
 >   * You can change these or add more if you'd like, but we should be able to identify at least these.
 > * There is no requirement for automation in the project board but feel free to explore those options.
 > * Create an "Epic" (note) for each feature and each design pattern and assign them to the appropriate team member. Place these in the `Backlog` column
 > * Complete your first *sprint planning* meeting to plan out the next 7 days of work.
 >   * Create smaller development tasks as issues and assign them to team members. Place these in the `Backlog` column.
 >   * These cards should represent roughly 7 days worth of development time for your team, taking you until your first meeting with the TA
## Class Diagram
 > Include a class diagram(s) for each design pattern and a description of the diagram(s). This should be in sufficient detail that another group could pick up the project this point and successfully complete it. Use proper OMT notation (as discussed in the course slides). You may combine multiple design patterns into one diagram if you'd like, but it needs to be clear which portion of the diagram represents which design pattern (either in the diagram or in the description). 
 
 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in with the TA (during lab hours or office hours). Your entire team must be present. 
 > * Before the meeting you should perform a sprint plan like you did in Phase II
 > * In the meeting with your TA you will discuss: 
 >   - How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 >   - Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 >   - Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 >   - What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the TA during lab time. The TA will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Kanban board. 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
